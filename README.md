# DeckBuilder

This project reads Excel files that stores the One Piece Cards in order of :

Name    Cost    Power   Counter     Type    Effect

Then Stores Them in Class Card then randoms all the cards in the Excel file but it does not go more than 4 cards in the Deck 

Then returns the Deck back to you with one Leader each.
